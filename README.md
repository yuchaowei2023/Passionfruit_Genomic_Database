# [Passionfruit Genomic Database](http://passionfruit.com.cn)

Passionfruit Genomics Database (PGD)  is a trial version of a passion fruit genome website, constructed through collaboration between Professor Fang Shouguo's research group at Yangtze University and Professor Wu Zujian's research group at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, has been launched and can be accessed at http://passionfruit.com.cn/. The specific work was completed by postdoctoral researcher Yu Chaowei. We welcome everyone to try it out or recommend its use and provide valuable feedback.

## Features

* PGD provides accessibility, analysis, and visualization of passionfruit genomic data.
* The PGD website offers a plethora of interactive analysis tools, enabling basic and batch queries, download options, BLAST, use of a genome browser,
* The PGD offers a diverse range of tools to facilitate the querying, analysis, and visualization of molecular interactions.



## Examples

Access using any browser http://passionfruit.com.cn 

### Search Module of PGD
* You can quickly search for data by clicking the "Search" button at the top of the page
* You can search for annotated datasets through the dropdown "Annotation Search" menu, including gene loci, Motif/Domain, KEGG, GO, and non coding RNA annotation data.
### Jbrowse Module of PGD

* JBrowse is a widely used interactive genome visualization browser used to display genomic data resources. We integrate the JBrowse tool into PGD and import all publicly available passion fruit RNA Seq, genome data, and annotation data (common feature format files) into JBrowse

### Heatmap and Enrichment analysis Modules of PGD

* PGD provides a visual interface for gene expression heatmap, providing two search methods: search by gene family or keyword, or search by gene ID list

### Analysis tools Modules of PGD

* PGD provides a very useful set of analytical and visual bioinformatics tools for exploring and analyzing genomic data
